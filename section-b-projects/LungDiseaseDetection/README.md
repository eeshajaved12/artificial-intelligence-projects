Problem Statement: Skin diseases, including melanoma and other dermatological conditions, are among the most common health issues worldwide. Early diagnosis plays a critical role in preventing severe complications and improving patient outcomes. However, traditional diagnosis relies on dermatologists visually inspecting skin lesions, which can be time-consuming and subjective, especially in areas with limited access to specialists.
With the rapid growth of medical image data, there is a strong need for an automated system that can assist healthcare professionals by accurately detecting and classifying skin diseases from images. This project aims to develop a deep learning–based solution using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.
